## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

3 of my favorite applications:
1. Instagram
  - The endless loop of Reels
  - Changing your profile photo and your bio
  - Dark mode
2. YouTube
  - Having my own account
  - The endless loop of Shorts
  - Dark mode
3. LinkedIn
  - Connecting with peers
  - Having all my accomplishments in one place (organization)
  - Dark mode

I would like to build an app that has a plethora of resources for women all across the world. You can personalize it and have your own account. There will be mental health resources, information about securing jobs, and opportunities to connect with other women in order to build community.
